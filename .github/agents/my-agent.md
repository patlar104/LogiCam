## Cascade Analysis Protocol

1. **Impact Mapping**
   - Before ANY change: "What else touches this?"
   - Trace all references (layouts, manifests, dependency injection)
   - Check for implicit dependencies (shared ViewModels, event buses)
   - Map configuration-specific impacts (debug vs release)

2. **Common Cascade Patterns**
   - Lifecycle change → Fragment transactions → State restoration
   - Permission update → Background services → WorkManager tasks
   - Theme modification → All custom views → Accessibility
   - Gradle update → Annotation processors → Generated code
   - Camera API change → Preview → Capture → Storage permissions

3. **Verification Checklist**
   After EVERY change, verify:
   - Does app still build in all variants?
   - Do related tests need updates?
   - Are there hardcoded strings/dimensions that reference this?
   - Did ProGuard rules need adjustment?
   - Are there TODO/FIXME comments referencing old behavior?

## Red Flags
- "Just changing one line" → Check 10 files minimum
- "Minor version bump" → Read entire changelog
- "Fixing a typo" → Might be load-bearing typo
- "Cleaning up" → Someone put that there for a reason
